                <h2>Case Study #1 - Amending Montana's Constitution</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes achieving a policy objective requires a bit more than the typical lobbying effort.</p>
 
<p>After successfully blocking a targeted tax proposal for years in the legislature, a Montana business association and their national parent organization had enough of fighting the same battle again and again. Their solution to ending the tax proposal once and for all was an amendment to Montana's constitution by specifically prohibiting the tax.</p>
<p>Working with the stakeholder organizations and a team of expert campaign vendors, we put our extensive grassroots-organization and political-management experience to work to successfully pass the constitutional amendment. The Montana Group helped to develop a campaign plan spanning the initial market research, to ballot qualification, to electioneering and get-out-the-vote programs. Our own Chuck Denowh served as the official campaign manager and primary, on-the-record spokesperson for the campaign.</p>
<p>The first challenge faced by the effort was to qualify the initiative for Montana's General Election. Ballot access requires a significant petitioning effort—10% of Montana voters—with required geographic diversity. We helped coordinate a team of paid-petitions and volunteers throughout the state and came in ahead of schedule with a number of signatures that exceeded our goal.</p>
<p>Once the initiative qualified for the ballot, the next phase of the campaign was to increase and maintain support for it leading into November. Using an extensive network of grassroots activists, earned media, and a full-scale direct mail, radio, and television advertising campaign we were able to increase awareness of the ballot initiative and its underlying issues.</p>
<p>And what a success. On Election Day we achieved a landslide victory, winning in every county with a total of 73% of the vote.</p>

                <h2>Case Study #2 - Winning a Presidential Caucus</h2>
                <p>With large geographic distances and an even larger diversity of culture, the political landscape in Montana can be difficult to navigate, let alone organize a statewide grassroots effort. But that's exactly what is necessary to win a Presidential Caucus. 
</p>
<p>The Montana Group's grassroots ability was put to the test in the first-ever Presidential Caucus in Montana with the challenge of assembling an effective caucus organization in each of Montana's 56 counties. After developing a sophisticated voter tracking system, we implemented a volunteer phone survey program to identify those caucus-goers already in our camp, those committed to other candidates, and, most importantly, those still on the fence and persuadable.</p>
<p>From there we switched gears to focus on volunteer advocacy calls to the uncommitted voters, and a letter-to-the-editor writing campaign to shore up support behind our candidate. The final phase was a GOTV effort to ensure that our identified supporters would make it to their county caucus.</p>
<p>The entire plan worked with great success—we won with a double-digit lead over the next-closest candidate.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="assets/img/grassroots.jpg" alt="grassroots" class="img-circle img-responsive" style="float:left">
                <h2>Case Study #3 - Building an advocacy group</h2>
<p>A grassroots movement usually starts with just a handful of committed activists passionate about an issue. From there it can snowball into a full-fledged advocacy organization with enough critical mass to become a sustained effort.</p>
 
<p>What starts with a single-issue can evolve into a group with the ability to take on multiple issue-fronts; and what a gratifying experience to help those initial activists achieve something far greater than they had originally envisioned was possible. But what determines whether an organization flourishes or fails is how it establishes its foundation. </p>
<p>Utilizing our expertise in organizational management , public relations and issue advocacy, the Montana Group helped one local start-up achieve a statewide presence and staying power that has helped them grow and establish themselves as a major force in Montana’s political environment. The United Property Owners of Montana was founded to focus on a localized controversy over hunting licenses in a handful of Central-Montana counties. That skirmish eventually developed into a full-fledged property rights cause for the group's founders and initial members. Today, UPOM has members across the state and represents nearly two million acres of privately owned property in Montana.</p>
<p>The Montana Group was there to help them at every stage of their development. We assisted with their initial message development to combat the hunting license controversy that initiated their founding. We directed an ongoing membership drive to expand their base, which also prompted them to increase the scope of the issues they addressed. And we helped them develop a legislative agenda and served as their primary lobbying team for the past two legislative sessions.</p>
<p>With our help, what started as a single-issue, temporary group has struck a chord with property owners throughout Montana and become one of the most-respected, most-effective rural advocacy groups in the state.</p>		</div>
